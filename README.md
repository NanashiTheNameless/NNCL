# NNCL

Nameless Nanashi Code License

Inspired by [Avris's OQL](<https://oql.avris.it/>) I decided I would make my own more strict license.

See the license in the [LICENSE.md](<LICENSE.md>) file

## NNCL v1.3 License TL;DR

**This is a simplified summary and does not replace the full license terms.**

### What You Can Do

- Use, study, modify, and share the work for free
- Create and distribute modified versions
- Deploy it for personal and non-commercial purposes

### What You Must Do

- Provide proper attribution to the licensor (me)
- Provide source code if you distribute compiled versions
- Include the full license with all distributions
- Maintain the ethical policy in your adaptations

### What You Cannot Do

- Use it for racism, xenophobia, queerphobia, transphobia, homophobia, enbyphobia, misogyny, misandry, and/or sexism.
- Use it for commercial purposes (sales, subscriptions, SaaS, ads, etc.)
- Train commercial AI or ML models with it
- Use it to enable discrimination or violence
- Alter or remove the license terms
- Use it for law enforcement, military, or immigration enforcement

### Key Points

- All modified versions must use the same license
- The licensor can revoke your rights with 7 days notice
- No warranties or guarantees are provided
- Large-scale deployments (100+ users) require public compliance documentation
- Filing patent lawsuits automatically terminates your license

### Bottom Line

Free for ethical, non-commercial use, with the requirement to share your code and keep the license intact.
